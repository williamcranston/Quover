Synced Lyrics - Uses a visually pleasing UI. 

Seperate tabs - Includes but is not limited to: Tracks, Albums, Artists, Genres, Favourites. 

Home tab - Includes a couple carousels which includes items such as: Recently played, Recently added, [Artist] Discography, Favourites, and possibly more in the future.

Nicer overall looks - Uses metadata from currently undetermined sources to make the experience feel more collected and clean. User will also be able to add an artist image for extra customization.

Classical section - An entire section for classical music. As it is a very different genre from any other type of music, and with some inspiration from a certain large American conglomerate, a classical music section will be added. This is so that items within can be sorted away from traditional ways of doing so. This will also be avaialble as a tab.

Standby Mode - For devices which do not have an in-built standby mode or similar, an inbuilt standby mode will be avaialble. This will include a large album/song cover at the forefront, a battery icon in the top right, the name and artist of the song, and large skip buttons below the album cover on each side. This is available in portrait and landscape mode.

Car mode - Not able to detect when it is connected to a car, but the UI option is still there. The button for enabling will be in the player by default, but is able to be turned off by the user.
